# Web-O-Mania-WeCare
This is my submission for WEB-O-MANIA.
'WeCare', A Fully Dynamic & Complete Covid Guideline.

Just Execute "index.html" to dive deep into Covid information.

This website called "WeCare" is developed by me to bind all information in an amazing and crisp way at one place.
Major features of it are:
Easy Navigation,news feed with amazing animation on clicking on news images,
Covid status section with rotating cube effects, doctors information with effect which gives it an aesthetic look.
Also I have added a Fully functional Blogs section,in which a person can add ,read ,edit and delete blogs and even on logging in Your complete profile will be 
visible in blog section.One of the best part of this website is A "Day Scheduler" which will help everyone to manage their day like have 
they taken medicine,drink enough water and etc....

Also a section of Top Advices by Doctor has been embedded in this website. 
And a fabulous part is a part of section is in which you can rate the website and according to your ratings progress bar 's progress will be incremented.
Even I have used an API to fetch data so that all information regarding available beds can be found by just entering state name.



So go and explore WeCare.You are just a click away from a pool full of Covid information....
